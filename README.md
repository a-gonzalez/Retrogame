Remaking retro games with javascript, css and html

Spaceships, lazers and aliens. Let's build a game from scratch with plain vanilla JavaScript and learn about game development and object-oriented programming. Our JavaScript game will be loosely inspired by the iconic space invaders arcade, but we will add some fun bonus features like super weapons, boss battles and different enemy types. While we do that we will learn about fundamental programming principles with JavaScript and object-oriented programming. 

Space Invaders was released in arcades across Japan in the summer of 1978. Back in the day, the processors were not powerful enough to move the entire army of aliens at the speed the designer Tomohiro Nishikado intended, but as the player defeated enemies, it freed more processor memory and the game was getting faster and faster the fewer enemies were on screen. It also affected the speed of background music. It wasn't intended but this rising difficulty bug became a game feature. We will create a variation on this by making the enemies come in larger and larger waves. I will be using NO frameworks and no libraries and I will explain every line of code as usual, because only when you fully understand the code can you modify and add your own features later if that's what you want to do.
