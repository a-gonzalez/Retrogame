Remaking retro games with javascript, css and html

Spaceships, lazers and aliens. Let's build a game from scratch with plain vanilla JavaScript and learn about game development and object-oriented programming. Our JavaScript game will be loosely inspired by the iconic space invaders arcade, but we will add some fun bonus features like super weapons, boss battles and different enemy types. While we do that we will learn about fundamental programming principles with JavaScript and object-oriented programming.
